            <h2>What is a funeral plan?</h2>
            <p>Having a funeral plan is a way to pay for your funeral in advance. This means whoever arranges your funeral won't have to pay and they'll know what your funeral wishes were.</p>
            <ul class="tick-list">
                <li>Peace of mind knowing your funeral is paid for</li>
                <li>People know your funeral wishes</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What's not included in a funeral plan</h3>
            <p>Our funeral plans include all the elements needed for a funeral. They're not suitable if you want a military funeral or burial at sea.</p>
            <p>It's also not possible for us to guarantee certain religious requirements with a funeral plan, such as arranging a cremation with 24 hours.</p>
            <p>We will always do our best to follow wishes you leave within your funeral plan. For more information speak to a local funeral director.</p>

            <h3>If you have a terminal illness</h3>
            <p>A funeral plan might not be right for you if you have a terminal illness and a prognosis of up to 12 months. This is because funeral plans are priced differently than today's funerals and you might end up paying more.</p>
            <p>We can help you make plans for your funeral by speaking to one of <a href="#">our funeral directors</a>.</p>

            <h2>Check if you qualify for a plan</h2>
            <p>To buy a plan you must:</p>
            <ul class="tick-list">
                <li>Be over 18</li>
                <li>Buy the plan for yourself. If you need to buy a plan on behalf of someone and you have power of attorney, please <a href="#"></a>visit your local funeral home</a>.</li>
                <li>Not have made any other provisions for your funeral to be paid for, for example taken out an Over 50s plan or have a life insurance plan for funeral expenses.</li>
            </ul>
